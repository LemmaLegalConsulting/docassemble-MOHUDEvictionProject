        PROTOCOLS FOR HOUSING INTAKES

        Housing is focusing on eviction lawsuits. Thus, we ask workers to do intakes on court 
        matters only. (There are a few exceptions listed below.)

        Court Summons The court matters we will mostly take are cases with summons dates, 
        (first court date, non-trial date). This includes subsidized housing and private 
        landlord/tenant as usual.

        Other Court Matters 
        
        We will also take default judgments, consent judgments, cases 
        already set for trial, and sheriff evictions with the following limitations. 
        Default Judgment: If caller contacts us within Ten (10) calendar days from the 
        date of the default judgment, then please do the intake.

        Cases Already set for Trial: If the caller contacts LSEM at least Ten (10) calendar 
        days from the date of the trial, then it is OK to do the intake.

        Sheriff Evictions Posted and Consent Judgments: Call and/or email me before
        doing the intake. We will take these, but are limited based on the specific facts of 
        the case, which I have to look at before agreeing to open a case.
        
        
        Section 8
        Please do an intake for a caller facing a proposed termination of Section 8, i.e. if the 
        caller has received a proposed termination of Section 8 notice from their local housing authority.

        Domestic Violence
        If domestic violence is present, they should call for a full screening.

        Other Housing Matters
        For other Housing matters, please refer the caller to the Housing section of
        our website.
