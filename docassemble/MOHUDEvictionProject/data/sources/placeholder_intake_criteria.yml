        LSEM wants to assist tenants in defending eviction lawsuits whenever possible. These include rent and possession, unlawful detainer, and other eviction lawsuits. Other issues that are not eviction lawsuits must fit into one of several exceptions provided below. In addition, cases that are too close to a pending court hearing or trial may be cases LSEM would turn away. 

        In general, if a tenant has a court case for eviction that is at least 7 days prior to a trial date for the eviction case, we will probably take that case.  If the eviction case trial is less than 7 days away, it is unlikely that we can assist the tenant because there is not enough time to do so before the trial. However, some expceptions apply as explained below.

        If a tenant has been sued for eviction and that court case has a non-trial hearing date (e.g. a return date, a continuance date, or a call docket or status conference hearing) and the court date is at least three business days away, then we can probably take that case. Business days exclude Saturdays, Sundays, and most government holidays.

        Some exceptions to the above rules exist, particularly for certain cases we might take that do not fit the time standards above for either the time before a trial date or a non-trial hearing date include: 
        
        1.	We will assist tenants that have a default judgments, consent judgments, cases already set for trial, and sheriff evictions with the following limitations. 
        a.	Default Judgment: If a tenant has a default judgment against them on the eviction case, but makes contact for intake within Ten (10) calendar days after the date of the default judgment, we would likely take that case.
        b.	 Sheriff Evictions post trial is pending: depending on the facts of the case, we may assist tenants who were misled or entered a consent judgment and the tenant has a reason the eviction is improper or illegal.
        2.	Section 8 cases are another exception. If a tenant is facing a proposed termination of their Section 8 housing assistance, regardless of whether a court eviction case has been filed or a trial is pending, that tenant's matter will usually make them eligible for legal aid help, because we prioritize preserving tenant's Section 8 Vouchers whenever possible. 
        3.	Another exception is tenants facing domestic violence, or those that have moved because domestic violence is present. LSEM usually will want to assist such tenants regardless of whether or not a court case is filed or near a trial date because domestic violence cases often have special circumstances and risks. Please consider anyone that is a victim of domestic violence likely to be eligible for legal aid.  
        For tenants that are interested in making claims against a landlord (whether or not they are being evicted or a court case has been filed against the tenant) we have other stanadards of eligibility. 

        Uninhabitable Conditions in Rental Property. We will only defend against or sue a landlord when there are extremely poor conditions (no heat, sewage backup, holes in the roof, windows or doors missing or unlockable, vermin, etc.) or the landlord has engaged in outrageous conduct against the tenant (lockout, theft, utility shut-off, physical violence or threats of violence, threats to destroy property or to “kick out “ the tenant without a court case, etc.).
        
        If a tenant is an Older Adult 60+ years old, and lives in the City of St. Louis City the tenant would usually be eligible for any of the above reasons or if there is specific evidence of elder financial abuse that exceeds $5,000. For example if an elderly tenant claims a landlord or relative stole money or forced them to sell a home they did not want to sell, that person would likely be eligible. 

        For making claims against a Landlord, management company, or landlord's attorney, we usually find the below circumstances result in an eligible tenant for legal aid assistance: 
        i. Conditions: Tenant must have notified Landlord of conditions issues and landlord has failed to address issues after notice. Any conditions of the premises that are bad enough that a reasonable person would move out if they could. Minor issues are not sufficient! 
        Example of severe issues that would likely make a tenant eligible for legal aid:
        1. Threat to safety and security of unit (doors won't lock, windows can't close, exit doors boarded over, etc.
        2. No heat or ventilation
        3. Water leaks causing damage to property
        4. Plumbing: no water, no hot water, sewage backups, damages to property from leaks, etc.
        5. Vermin, overwhelming and affecting health and safety of occupants.
        6. Bedbugs
        ii. Recent (within 30 days) Unfair or Outrageous Landlord Activities such as:
        1. Lockouts, utility shut-offs, nailing doors/windows shut,
        2. Renting the tenant a property that was condemned 
        3. Self-help eviction by landlord through force or threats or changing locks without tenant permission
        4. Taking or destroying of tenant personal property

        4. HOUSING - Tenant Claims Against Landlords
        a. ONLY IF tenant has solid damage claims against the landlord, management, or landlord lawyer.
        b. Bad Conditions: Tenant must have notified Landlord of conditions issues and landlord has failed to address issues after notice. Any conditions of the premises that are bad enough that a reasonable person would move out if they could. 
        Examples:
        i. Security of unit (doors won't lock, windows can't close, etc.)
        ii. No heat or ventilation
        iii. Leaking roof causing damage
        iv. Plumbing causing sewage backups
        v. Vermin that are overwhelming and directly affecting health and safety of
        occupants.
        vi. Bedbugs, etc.
        c. Unfair or Outrageous Landlord Activities (within last 30 days or so) such as:
        i. Lockouts, utility shut-offs, nailing doors/windows shut
        ii. Renting condemned property
        iii. Self-help eviction by landlord
        iv. Taking, throwing away, or destroying tenant's personal property
