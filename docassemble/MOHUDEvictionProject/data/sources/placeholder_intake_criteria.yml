        PROTOCOLS FOR HOUSING INTAKES

        Housing is focusing on eviction lawsuits. Thus, we ask workers to do intakes on court 
        matters only. (There are a few exceptions listed below.)

        Court Summons The court matters we will mostly take are cases with summons dates, 
        (first court date, non-trial date). This includes subsidized housing and private 
        landlord/tenant as usual.

        Other Court Matters 
        
        We will also take default judgments, consent judgments, cases 
        already set for trial, and sheriff evictions with the following limitations. 
        Default Judgment: If caller contacts us within Ten (10) calendar days from the 
        date of the default judgment, then please do the intake.

        Cases Already set for Trial: If the caller contacts LSEM at least Ten (10) calendar 
        days from the date of the trial, then it is OK to do the intake.

        Sheriff Evictions Posted and Consent Judgments: Call and/or email me before
        doing the intake. We will take these, but are limited based on the specific facts of 
        the case, which I have to look at before agreeing to open a case.
        
        
        Section 8
        Please do an intake for a caller facing a proposed termination of Section 8, i.e. if the 
        caller has received a proposed termination of Section 8 notice from their local housing authority.

        Domestic Violence
        If domestic violence is present, they should call for a full screening.

        Other Housing Matters
        For other Housing matters, please refer the caller to the Housing section of
        our website.

        Uninhabitable Conditions in Rental Property. We will only defend against or sue a landlord
        when there are extremely poor conditions (no heat, sewage backup, etc.) or the landlord has
        engaged in outrageous conduct (lockout, theft, utility shut-off, etc.).
