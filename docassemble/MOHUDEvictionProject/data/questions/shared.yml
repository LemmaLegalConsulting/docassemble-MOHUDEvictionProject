  you can check your landlord's name online on a free website run by the

  court person to put your answer in the right spot. But, if you know the 
  name they used on the court papers, you can just write it down without 
  checking online.

  You can also use the Case.net website to check other information,
  like your court date and the case number.

  We can give you step by step instructions if you want to check online.
