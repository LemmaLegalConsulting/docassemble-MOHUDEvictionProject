  Ask your landlord questions to get ready for court
subquestion:
  You have the right to have your landlord answer some questions and give you some documents 
  before trial. This is called "discovery."

  This website includes a list of common questions to ask and documents to ask your landlord for.

  Based on your answers, we will ask your landlord ${ interrogatories.count_checked() }
  questions and ${ requests_for_production.count_checked() } documents.

  You can change the list of questions and documents if you want to.

  Most tenants use the default questions and documents.
