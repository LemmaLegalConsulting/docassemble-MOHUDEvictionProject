question: |
  Defend against an Eviction
subquestion: |
  <h2 class="h4">How this works</h2>
  One the next screens you will:

  1. Tell us about your eviction case.
  1. Tell us why you should not be evicted.
  1. Tell us about problems in your home and in your landlord's case that may
     stop your eviction.

  At the end of the questions, you will have completed documents that you
  need to deliver to your landlord and to the court. The documents make up
  your "Answer" and motions for your eviction case.

  <h2 class="h4">Before you start</h2>
  1. Get ready to print and deliver these documents. We can help you
     fill in the documents, but you need to deliver them on your own.
  1. Do your best to find any documents from the court and your landlord about the eviction, including:
      - The Summons from the court
      - The Landlord's petition
      - The eviction notice
      - Your lease
  
  **Currently, we can only help when your landlord is evicting you because you have not paid your rent.**  This type of eviction is called a Rent and Possession case.  If you are being evicted for another reason, contact [a Missouri legal aid provider](https://www.lsmo.org/).

question: |
  You may not want to file an answer
subquestion: |
  You said that you got the Summons and Petition by "posting" (taping, stapling or pinning to your door) or that you did not receive the Summons and Petition at all.

  Because your landlord did not mail the Summons and Petition, if you file an answer, the court may order 
  you to pay money that you would not need to pay otherwise.

  You may still want to keep going if:

  * You want to find out if you have a defense that can stop the eviction
  * You think your landlord will owe you more money than you owe them

  You do not need to decide now. If you keep going, we will remind you about your choices at the end.
  You may want to talk to a lawyer to decide for sure.
