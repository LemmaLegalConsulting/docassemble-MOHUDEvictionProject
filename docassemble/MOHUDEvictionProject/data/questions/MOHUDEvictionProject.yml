  About this interview
subquestion: |
  **What's this about?**: This is a place to tell your side of the story about you, 
  your landlord, and why they want to evict you.

  Your answers complete your **{answer|Eviction Answer}** form and any other forms that you need.
  You will need to **print** and **deliver**
  the forms to the court on your own.

  <h2 class="h4">What to do</h2>

  1. Be honest and give full answers.
  1. Put a check next to things that are true, even if they don't seem related.
  1. If you are not sure, it's okay to skip a question. Giving some answers is 
    better than none.
  1. Sometimes, you might want to look up an answer. That's okay! But looking up some 
    things can take time and might be tricky. If you can't find the answer, or it's taking 
    too long, it's okay to leave the question blank.
  4. Filling this out doesn't stop talks with your landlord. It might help you both
     agree about what is fair.

  <h2 class="h4">What documents to find now</h2>

  Before you start, try to find these documents from the court and your landlord:

  1. The {Summons} from the court
  1. The Landlord's {petition}
  1. The eviction {notice}
  1. Your {lease}

  If you can't find a document, it is okay to keep going. Just do your best to answer
  the questions from what you remember.
