  About this interview
subquestion: |
  **What's this about?**: This is a place to tell your side of the story about you, 
  your landlord, and why they want to evict you.

  Your answers complete your **Eviction Answer** form and any other forms that you need.
  You will need to **print** and **deliver**
  the forms to the court on your own.

  <h2 class="h4">What to do</h2>

  1. Be honest and give full answers.
  1. Put a check next to things that are true, even if they don't seem related.
  1. If you are not sure, it's okay to skip a question. Giving some answers is 
    better than none.
  1. Sometimes, you might want to look up an answer. That's okay! But looking up some 
    things can take time and might be tricky. If you can't find the answer, or it's taking 
    too long, it's okay to leave the question blank.
  4. Filling this out doesn't stop talks with your landlord. It might help you both
     agree about what is fair.

  <h2 class="h4">What documents to find now</h2>

  Before you start, try to find these documents from the court and your landlord:

  1. The Summons from the court
  1. The Landlord's petition
  1. The eviction notice
  1. Your lease

  If you can't find a document, it is okay to keep going. Just do your best to answer
  the questions from what you remember.

  You may have defenses to the eviction
subquestion: |
  Based on your answers, you may have the following defenses to the eviction case:
  % if defense_rent_pleading_requirement:
  
  **Landlord failed to state a claim for rent and possession**

  A landlord must include specific things in the landlord's petition in order to be able to evict.  Your landlord failed to include the following things: 
  % if petition_alleges_nonrent == True:
  
   - a claim that you owe rent (the petition says that you owe for other charges)
  % endif
  % if petition_states_rent_amount == False:
  
   - an exact amount of what you owe in rent
  % endif
  % if petition_states_rent_periods == False:
  
   - the months that you supposedly owe rent
  % endif
  % if petition_states_demand_made == False:
  
   - a claim that the landlord demanded rent from you
  % endif
  % endif
  % if defense_lease_not_attached:
  
  **Landlord has failed to comply with M.R.C.P. § 55.22**

  A landlord must attach the written lease to the landlord's petition to be able to evict.  
  % endif
  % if defense_tender_refused:
  
  **Landlord refused Tenant’s tender of rent**

  Landlord refused payment before the lawsuit was filed: For example, you presented the landlord the full amount of money you owed prior to the lawsuit but the landlord refused to accept the money. You should ask the judge to dismiss the case because you offered to pay the landlord the money you owed and the landlord refused to accept the money. You will need proof such as a letter from the landlord refusing to accept the money, a written check or money order or a witness to the landlord’s refusal. If you have no proof, you can offer to pay the amount claimed plus court costs in front of the judge. Make sure you have a certified check, money order or cash for the full amount with you. Full payment of rent owed plus court costs is your best defense. 	
  % endif
  % if defense_rent_payment:
  
  **Tenant has paid the rent allegedly owed**

  A landlord also needs to allege that you didn't make the payment that you were obligated to make.
  % endif
  % if defense_settlement:
  
  **Landlord and Tenant entered into a settlement agreement and Tenant has complied with the settlement’s terms**

  
  % endif
  % if defense_lease_signed_under_duress:
  
  **The lease is invalid because unfair duress by Landlord caused Tenant to enter the lease**

  
  % endif
  % if defense_fraud_lease:
  
  **Landlord’s fraudulent promises induced Tenant to enter the lease**

  
  % endif
  % if defense_liquidated_damages_late_fees:
  
  **The late fees attached to the Landlord’s Petition are** 
  % if late_fees_penalty:
  **an unfair penalty**
  % if not late_fees_lease_provision or late_fee_doesnt_comply_with_lease:
  **and** 
  % endif
  % endif
  % if not late_fees_lease_provision or late_fee_doesnt_comply_with_lease:
  **an unauthorized charge**
  % endif  

  % if late_fees_penalty:
  Late fees must be based on what it actually costs the landlord when a tenant pays late.  
  % endif
  % if not late_fees_lease_provision:
  Late fees can't be charged if the late fees are not authorized by the lease.
  % elif late_fee_doesnt_comply_with_lease:
  Late fees that do not comply with the lease can't be charged.
  % endif

  This defense alone may not help you avoid the eviction, but it can reduce the amount of money you owe the landlord.
  % endif
  % if defense_estoppel_illegality:
  
  **Landlord is estopped from enforcement of the lease because it has violated Missouri law**

  "Estopped" means that the landlord should be prevented from benefiting from a lease if the landlord already violated the law.
  % endif
  % if defense_breach_of_habitability:
  
  **Landlord has breached the implied warranty of habitability**

  For example, your landlord has let the building run down and has not fixed major problems such as lack of running water, even after being notified of such problems. You should ask the judge to let you stay and either continue to pay a lower rent, make the landlord pay you for damages caused by the landlord’s failure to make needed repairs or excuse you from paying all, or part of, the back rent owed. You will need proof such as photos, letters to your landlord asking for repairs, copies of code violation reports or witnesses such as the building inspector. In some cases, the court may ask for proof that you have set aside the money you did not pay.
  
  % endif
  % if defense_foreclosure:
  
  **The premises have been foreclosed upon but the Landlord has not followed proper procedures**

  There are special protections for tenants when their landlord loses the home through foreclosure.  The new owner of the home is required to provide notice of the foreclosure
  % endif
  % if defense_new_owner_failed_to_provide_notice_of_sale:
  
  **The premises have been sold but the prior Landlord has not provided Tenant the required notices and therefore no rent is owed**

  There are special protections for tenants when their landlord loses the home through foreclosure.  The new owner of the home is required to provide notice of the foreclosure
  % endif
  % if defense_unrepresented_corporation:
  
  **The Landlord is required to have an attorney in this case and it must be dismissed**

  A business entity, like a corporation, must have an attorney to evict a tenant in court.
  % endif
  % if defense_no_landlord_tenant_relationship:
  
  **There is no landlord-tenant relationship between the parties**

  This defense can be difficult to understand, if you have also said there is a lease between you and the landlord.  However, that lease may not be valid for because
  If the lease is not valid, then the landlord should not be able to evict you in a rent and possession action.
  % endif
  % if defense_excessive_rent_for_subsidized_housing:
  
  **Plaintiff has charged Defendant excessive rent in violation of the housing subsidy**

  
  % endif
