  % endif
  
  In order to serve a tenant personally a landlord must do one of the following things:
   - Have the sheriff or a process server hand the tenant the summons and petition
   - Send the summons and petition to the tenant through certified mail
   - Send the summons and petition to the tenant through regular mail and post the summons and petition at the tenant's door.
  
  Because your landlord did not serve you personally, the landlord cannot sue you for money damages.  If you file an answer, the court may order 
  you to pay money that you would not need to pay otherwise.

  You may still want to keep going if you:

  * Want to find out if you have a defense that can stop the eviction, or
  * Think your landlord will owe you more money than you owe them.

  You do not need to decide now. If you keep going, we will remind you about your choices at the end.
  You may want to talk to a lawyer to decide for sure.

  most tenants file an answer.  An answer is a document that you file with the court to respond to the landlord's petition.  You can explain why you shouldn't be evicted in an answer.

  Filing an answer may:

  * Stop your eviction, or
  * Lower the amount that you need to pay your landlord,

  or both.

  Defend against an Eviction
subquestion: |
  <h2 class="h4">How this works</h2>
  On the next screens you will tell us:

  1. About your eviction case.
  1. Why you should not be evicted.
  1. About problems in your home and in your landlord's case that may
     stop your eviction.

  Your answers will complete your forms. You will need to deliver your forms to the court on your own.

  <h2 class="h4">Before you start</h2>
  1. Get ready to download, print, and deliver your forms to the court. This tool will help you fill in your forms, but you need to deliver them to the court on your own.
  1. Do your best to find any documents from the court and your landlord about the eviction, including:
  
      - The Summons from the court
      - The Landlord's petition
      - The eviction notice
      - Your lease
  
  **Currently, we can only help when your landlord is evicting you because you have not paid your rent.**  This type of eviction is called a Rent and Possession case.  If you are being evicted for another reason, contact [a Missouri legal aid provider](https://www.lsmo.org/).
