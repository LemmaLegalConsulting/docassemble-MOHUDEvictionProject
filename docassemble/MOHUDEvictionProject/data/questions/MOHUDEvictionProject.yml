  % endif
  
  In order to serve a tenant personally a landlord must do one of the following things:
   - Have the sheriff or a process server hand the tenant the summons and petition
   - Send the summons and petition to the tenant through certified mail
   - Send the summons and petition to the tenant through regular mail and post the summons and petition at the tenant's door.
  
  Because your landlord did not serve you personally, the landlord cannot sue you for money damages.  If you file an answer, the court may order 
  you to pay money that you would not need to pay otherwise.

  You may still want to keep going if you:

  * Want to find out if you have a defense that can stop the eviction, or
  * Think your landlord will owe you more money than you owe them.

  You do not need to decide now. If you keep going, we will remind you about your choices at the end.
  You may want to talk to a lawyer to decide for sure.

question: |
  Defend against an Eviction
subquestion: |
  <h2 class="h4">How this works</h2>
  On the next screens you will tell us:

  1. About your eviction case.
  1. Why you should not be evicted.
  1. About problems in your home and in your landlord's case that may
     stop your eviction.

  At the end of the questions, you will have completed documents that you
  need to deliver to your landlord and to the court. The documents make up
  your "Answer" and motions for your eviction case.

  <h2 class="h4">Before you start</h2>
  1. Get ready to print and deliver these documents. We can help you
     fill in the documents, but you need to deliver them on your own.
  1. Do your best to find any documents from the court and your landlord about the eviction, including:
  
      - The Summons from the court
      - The Landlord's petition
      - The eviction notice
      - Your lease
  
  **Currently, we can only help when your landlord is evicting you because you have not paid your rent.**  This type of eviction is called a Rent and Possession case.  If you are being evicted for another reason, contact [a Missouri legal aid provider](https://www.lsmo.org/).

question: |
  ${ users[0].familiar() }, you can do this!
subquestion: |
  It takes most people about **30 minutes** to use this website. But you can 
  save your work and come back at any time.

  Just answer the questions on each screen as well as you can. Make sure
  to tell the truth.

  At the end you will have customized documents, ready to file in court.
