  Disability and reasonable accommodation
subquestion: |
  If you have a disability, you have the right to use your housing in the same 
  way as someone without a disability.

  You may have the right to a change in:

  * The rules of your housing, or
  * The physical structure of your housing.

  If the change would help you stay in your housing or solve the problem that
  the landlord is complaining about, it may be a defense (stop your eviction).

  The disability can be yours or it can be a disability of someone in your
  household.

  <h2 class="h4">Example 1: Child making noise</h2>
  A tenant had a child with autism. The child sometimes was loud
  and made noise.
  
  The landlord tried to evict the tenant because of the noise.

  The tenant's child was about to start a new therapy that might help
  calm the child down. The tenant asked the landlord to give the new
  therapy a try. The tenant also said they would try putting down
  more rugs on the floors.

  A judge ordered the landlord to accept the tenant's request for
  an accommodation to the rules because it was reasonable and it was 
  related to the child's disability.

  <h2 class="h4">Example 2: late payment of rent</h2>
  A tenant's only source of income is their monthly check from Social Security. Sometimes
  the check comes after the first of the month. The landlord wants to evict them for 
  late payment of rent.

  The tenant asks the landlord to allow them to pay rent on the 10th of each month
  instead of on the 1st.

  A judge orders the landlord to accept the accommodation because the landlord
  is not harmed by waiting several days to get the rent payment.

  What is a disability?
content: |
  A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.

  Major life activities include:

  * Caring for yourself
  * Performing manual tasks
  * Seeing
  * Hearing
  * Eating
  * Sleeping
  * Walking
  * Standing
  * Lifting
  * Bending
  * Speaking
  * Breathing
  * Learning
  * Reading
  * Concentrating
  * Thinking
  * Communicating
  * Working

  You do **not** need to be disabled all the time to have a disability.
  You do not need a doctor's diagnosis to have a disability. But it 
  may help to prove your case in court.
