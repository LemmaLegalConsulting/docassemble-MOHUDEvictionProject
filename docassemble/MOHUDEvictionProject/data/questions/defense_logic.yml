  What counts as a false promise?
content: |
  If your landlord told you something that got you to sign the lease and
  that turned out not to be true, it may be a false promise.

  For example:

  * Promising to paint a room, or
  * Promising to replace a carpet, or
  * Promising that an old appliance would get replaced before you moved in

  Those may count as false promises. What matters is that you would not
  have signed the lease if your landlord hadn't told you something that
  turned out not to be true.
