  Defense: Person suing is not the landlord
  May want to vary if the landlord was a Business or Organization.
  May want to split onto separate screens
  
  If does_landlord_match == False, then include Person suing is not the landlord defense
    "There is no landlord-tenant relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant in this case."
question: |
  % if person_answering == "tenant":
  Does the name of the Plaintiff match the name of your landlord?
  % else:
  Does the name of the Plaintiff match the name of the tenant's landlord?
  % endif 
subquestion: |
  % if person_answering == "tenant":
  Only your landlord may file a case to evict you. Your landlord is the person you made your lease agreement with.
  
  If the person filing to evict you is not your landlord, the court may dismiss the case.
  % else:
  Only the tenant's landlord may file a case to evict them. The tenant's landlord is the person the tenant made their lease agreement with.
  
  If the person filing to evict the tenant is not their landlord, the court may dismiss the case.

      This would be in the "facts" section of the Petition.

  Defense: Attornment
  Only SHOW IF is_landlord_status_alleged == True
  
  If was_deed_shown == True, then DO include Attornment defense.
    ???
    (originally thought Attornment shouldn't be included in this case, but what if the user has seen the deed but it contained a different name than their landlord?)
  If was_deed_shown == False, then DO include Attornment defense.
    "Defendant did not make lease agreement with Plaintiff. Defendant has not seen the deed to the property indicating that Plaintiff indeed owns the property.
    IF is_ownership_reliable == True, then include:
      "The only information Defendant has received as to who owns the property is (ownership_reliable_explanation)
  
  OR MAYBE more simply "There is no attornment between Plaintiff and Defendant in this case."
question: |
  % if person_answering == "tenant":
  Has ${ other_parties } shown you proof that they own the property?
  % else:
  Has ${ other_parties } shown the tenant proof that they own the property?
  % endif
subquestion: |
  % if person_answering == "tenant":
  If the person suing you claims to be your landlord, but has not shown you the deed to the property, 
  and you have not received any reliable information concerning ownership of the property, 
  the court may dismiss the case for lack of “attornment.”
  % else: 
  If the person suing the tenant claims to be the tenant's landlord, but has not shown the tenant the deed to the property, 
  and the tenant has not received any reliable information concerning ownership of the property, 
  the court may dismiss the case for lack of “attornment.”
