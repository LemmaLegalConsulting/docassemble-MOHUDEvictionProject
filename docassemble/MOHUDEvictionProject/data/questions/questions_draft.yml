  Defense: Person suing is not the landlord
  May want to vary if the landlord was a Business or Organization.
  May want to split onto separate screens
  
  If does_landlord_match == False, then include Person suing is not the landlord defense
    "There is no landlord-tenant relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant in this case."
question: Does the name of the Plaintiff match the name of your landlord?
subquestion: |
  Only your landlord may file a case to evict you. Your landlord is the person you made the lease agreement with.
  
  If the person filing to evict you is not your landlord, the court may dismiss the case.
fields:
  - Did you make the lease agreement with ${ other_parties }?: does_landlord_match
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - Who did you make the lease agreement with?: real_landlord
    dataype: text
    show if:
      variable: real_landlord
      is: False
  - Does the Petition allege that ${ other_parties } is your landlord?: is_landlord_status_alleged
    datatype: yesnoradio

      This would be in the "facts" section of the Petition.
    show if:
      variable: real_landlord
      is: False

  Defense: Attornment
  Only SHOW IF is_landlord_status_alleged == True
  
  If was_deed_shown == True, then DO include Attornment defense.
    ???
    (originally thought Attornment shouldn't be included in this case, but what if the user has seen the deed but it contained a different name than their landlord?)
  If was_deed_shown == False, then DO include Attornment defense.
    "Defendant did not make lease agreement with Plaintiff. Defendant has not seen the deed to the property indicating that Plaintiff indeed owns the property.
    IF is_ownership_reliable == True, then include:
      "The only information Defendant has received as to who owns the property is (ownership_reliable_explanation)
  
  OR MAYBE more simply "There is no attornment between Plaintiff and Defendant in this case."
question: Has ${ other_parties } shown you proof that they own the property?
subquestion:
  If the person suing you claims to be your landlord, but has not shown you the deed to the property, 
  and you have not received any reliable information concerning ownership of the property, 
  the court may dismiss the case for lack of “attornment.”
fields: 
  - Has the Plaintiff shown you the deed to the property?: was_deed_shown
    datatype: yesnoradio
  - Have you received any reliable information conerning who owns the property?: is_ownership_reliable
    datatype: yesnoradio
    show if:
      variable: was_deed_shown
      is: False
  - What reliable information?: ownership_reliable_explanation
