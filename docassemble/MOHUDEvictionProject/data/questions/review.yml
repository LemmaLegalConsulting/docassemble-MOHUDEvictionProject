      A landlord can't evict if the landlord refused payment before the lawsuit was filed. For example, you presented the landlord the full amount of money you owed prior to the lawsuit but the landlord refused to accept the money. You should ask the judge to dismiss the case because you offered to pay the landlord the money you owed and the landlord refused to accept the money. You will need proof such as a letter from the landlord refusing to accept the money, a written check or money order or a witness to the landlord’s refusal. If you have no proof, you can offer to pay the amount claimed plus court costs in front of the judge. Make sure you have a certified check, money order or cash for the full amount with you. Full payment of rent owed plus court costs is your best defense.

      A landlord can't evict if the landlord refused payment before the lawsuit was filed. For example, you presented the landlord the full amount of money you owed prior to the lawsuit but the landlord refused to accept the money. You should ask the judge to dismiss the case because you offered to pay the landlord the money you owed and the landlord refused to accept the money. You will need proof such as a letter from the landlord refusing to accept the money, a written check or money order or a witness to the landlord’s refusal. If you have no proof, you can offer to pay the amount claimed plus court costs in front of the judge. Make sure you have a certified check, money order or cash for the full amount with you. Full payment of rent owed plus court costs is your best defense.
