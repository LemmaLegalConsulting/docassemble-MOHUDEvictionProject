  You said that you got the Summons and Petition by "posting" (taping, stapling, or pinning to your door) or that you did not receive the Summons and Petition at all.

  Because your landlord did not serve you personally, the landlord cannot sue you for money damages.  If you file anything in court, including a motion to continue, the court may order you to pay money that you would not need to pay otherwise.

  You may still want to keep going if you:

  * Want to find out if you have a defense that can stop the eviction, or
  * Think your landlord will owe you more money than you owe them.

  You do not need to decide now. If you keep going, we will remind you about your choices at the end.
  You may want to talk to a lawyer to decide for sure.
  % else: 
  The tenant got the Summons and Petition by "posting" (taping, stapling, or pinning to their door) or that they did not receive the Summons and Petition at all.

  Because their landlord did not mail the Summons and Petition, if they file a motion to continue, the court may order 
  them to pay money that they would not need to pay otherwise.

  The tenant may still want to keep going if they:

  * Want to find out if they have a defense that can stop their eviction, or
  * Think their landlord will owe them more money then they owe the landlord.

  The tenant does not need to decide now. If they keep going, we will remind them about their choices at the end.
