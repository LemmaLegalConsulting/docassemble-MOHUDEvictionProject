   - Have the sheriff or a process server hand the tenant the summons and petition
   - Send the summons and petition to the tenant through certified mail
   - Send the summons and petition to the tenant through regular mail and post the summons and petition at the tenant's door.

  If your landlord did not serve you personally, the landlord cannot sue you for money damages.  If you file anything in court, including a motion to continue, the court may order you to pay money that you would not need to pay otherwise.

  You may still want to keep going if you:

  * Want to find out if you have a defense that can stop the {eviction}, or
  * Think your landlord will owe you more money than you owe them.
