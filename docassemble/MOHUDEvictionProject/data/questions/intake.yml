question: |
  Do you qualify to apply for **housing** help from a lawyer?
subquestion: |
  Missouri's free legal aid programs can help eligible tenants who:

  1. Are US citizens, Green Card holders, or meet an exception to legal residency requirements
  1. Have a lower income or otherwise fit income and asset requirements, and 
  1. Have a legal issue the program has the capacity and expertise to handle. 

  This AI chatbot, Missouri Legal Services AI Chatbot (MOLS) may help you decide if you are likely to be eligible for legal aid, and have a housing issue that your regional legal aid might accept. Chatting with MOS is a fast and easy way to take the first steps toward seeking free legal help from your local legal aid program. However, due to limited resources, not every eligible tenant can get a legal aid lawyer's help in every case.

  MOLS will ask you questions and give you answers. It will take about 5 minutes. Your data will be kept private and secure.

  How do you use AI?
content: |
  An AI model is a program, like ChatGPT, that looks at your
  answers to questions and the rules for your local legal
  aid organization. We currently use the OpenAI GPT-4-turbo

  We use the AI model to decide what follow-up questions you 
  need to answer and to help you understand if it is likely
  that you qualify for help.

  Is my information kept safe?

  Your answers are kept private and secure. We use encryption and other
  controls to limit access to your answers.

  * The company that makes the AI model does not have any ownership or right
    to use your answers. It will not be used to train the model or 
    for any purpose other than to answer your questions.
  * Information about your income, location and citizenship status is not given to
    the AI model.
  * The nonprofit legal aid provider who built this tool, Legal Services
    of Eastern Missouri, may look at your answers to improve the tool
    and to fix it if it is not working correctly.
  * Legal Services of Eastern Missouri may share your anonymous answers with other
    legal aid programs or researchers to help you and other tenants better
    in the future. For example: to test the performance of this and 
    other tools in the future against the way that real tenants ask for help. You can
