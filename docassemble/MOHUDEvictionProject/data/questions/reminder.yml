  If you agree, we can send you a reminder text message and email message when you
  have a deadline or need to appear in court. *The reminders will only be based on
  the information you gave us in this interview.* If your court date changes for
  any reason, keep in mind that the reminder might be for the wrong date. It's important
  that you still pay attention to the dates that the court tells you about.
  
  We can also save information about your case if you choose. Saved information
  will be used only by a non-profit legal aid organization. It may be used to help
  you if your case is accepted for full representation, or it may be used to identify
  trends to help the non-profit legal aid organization bettter decide how to use
  its resources to prevent evictions.
  
  Sharing your information is optional. You can use this service for free whether or not
  you want your information to be shared.
